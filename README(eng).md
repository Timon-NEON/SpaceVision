# Exosky
Exosky is a program that allows you to navigate through real space, view the night sky from different perspectives, and explore stars and exoplanets.

## Teleportation

In the program, you can teleport to specific coordinates or choose an exoplanet from a list of available options.

## Information about stars

In the program, you can view information about any star. To do this, press Control to enter cursor movement mode, then click on the star you want to learn more about.

## Hotkeys
